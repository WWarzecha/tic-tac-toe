# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, created as a part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Live Demo

You can play the game live here: **[https://wwarzecha.github.io/tic-tac-toe/](https://wwarzecha.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)**

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: For the basic structure of the game.
-   **CSS**: For styling the game board, fields, and modals.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all game logic, including state management, win detection, and DOM manipulation.

## How to Play

1.  Open the [Live Demo](https://wwarzecha.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) link.
2.  Optionally, enter custom names for Player 1 ("O") and Player 2 ("X").
3.  Player 1 starts by clicking on any empty square to place their "O".
4.  Players take turns placing their marks on the board.
5.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
6.  If the board is filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.
7.  After a game ends, click the on-screen modal or the "Restart" button to play again.
